## Taught at:

- Tilburg, Fall 2023

## Motivation

Digital and Social Media Strategies introduces students to the fundamentals of the digital marketplace. 
The class is designed to familiarize students with the most important aspects of
the main types of digital markets (such as advertising, online retail, search platforms, mobile marketing, and social media sites). 
Within each market we encounter, students will be introduced to the types of strategic questions marketers are working to answer and learn an analytics toolkit that they can employ to deliver the quantitative answers to inform strategic decision making.
The approach of decision driven analytics taught in this class puts students at the forefront of how leading scholars' and employers' approach digital marketing, with a toolkit that can be utilized in future academic study, and when working in the private sector at firms of any size and scope.

The course is split into 5 blocks:

1. **Prologue**: Refreshing statistical knowledge necessary for the class 
2. **Digital Advertising**: Attribution, Media Mix Models, Ghost Ads, Search Engine Ads, Email Marketing
3. **Social Media**: User Generated Content, Word of Mouth, Virality, Influencers
4. **Online Markets**: Mobile Marketing, Platforms, Online Retail
5. **Advanced Topics**: Search Engine Optimization, Digital Privacy

## Course Material

I taught this class for the first time in Fall 2022, so the course notes are still a bit rough around the edges.

I plan to release lecture notes, and course assignments at the conclusion of the Fall 2023. If you are interested in an advanced copy, drop me an email and I can share with you my materials from the first run.
