I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Marketing Group at University of Chicago Booth School of Business.

My current research combines structural econometrics with text as data, utilizing tools from Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing, to study:

- The impact of social media content on consumer demand for new products
- The interaction between offline advertising and online word of mouth
- How the structure of online networks influence the spread of information and decision making
