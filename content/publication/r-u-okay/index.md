abstract: "Peer-to-peer support is often a critical component of mental health programs, but evidence on the effect of peer-based support programs at scale is limited. Using quasi-experimental methods, we examine whether a prominent peer-based support campaign, R U OK? Day, affects short-term mental health outcomes in Australia. Using variation in daily records and differences in the campaignâ€™s intensity over nine years, we find no evidence that R U OK? Day reduces suicides and suicidal behaviours in the month after the campaign. However, we find positive effects on mental wellbeing, particularly among middle-aged males, with improved social support the likely mechanism. Our results provide evidence that peer support campaigns may be a practical, low-cost approach to improve population mental wellbeing."
