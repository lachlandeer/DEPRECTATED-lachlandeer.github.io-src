abstract: "Mental ill health and suicide have damaging and costly consequences. Peers of individuals at risk of suicide play an important role in suicide prevention. However, evidence on the effect of programs that promote peer-to-peer mental health support in the general population is limited. We use quasi-experimental methods to examine whether a national peer-based support campaign, R U OK? Day, affects mental health and suicide in the Australian population, in the month following the campaign. We use variation in a daily administrative death records and surveys of mental health before and after the campaign over 9 years (2011-2019). We compare the changes in the years when the campaign was highly active to the years when it was not. We find no evidence of an effect on suicides or Google searches about suicides or crisis helplines. However, the campaign has a small positive effect on mental health (4% of SD), which is largely driven by males aged 25-49. The effects were stronger for people living in economically disadvantaged areas. We show that improved perceived social support is a likely mechanism. Campaigns that harness peer support may be an effective and relatively low-cost way to improve mental wellbeing."
