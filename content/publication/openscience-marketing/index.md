abstract: "We make the case for a cultural shift towards open science in academic marketing research to
address growing concerns about research complexity and challenges surrounding replicability
and reproducibility. We discuss how open science can increase the scientific rigor and
credibility of research across diverse paradigms and practices within the field. We also
provide guidance on implementing open science in empirical research for authors, journals,
and institutions, highlighting the benefits and costs of adapting existing practices to the
fieldâ€™s subdisciplines. Implementing open science practices requires concerted and
collaborative efforts among authors, journals, and institutions to integrate its principles into
their specific practices and policies."
